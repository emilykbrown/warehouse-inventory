# Warehouse Inventory

## Project Over

I built a system to keep track of the inventory of a warehouse that carries supplies to restraunts. I am planning on expanding this into a bigger project for my portfolio.

## Tech Stack

I used PHP with a MVC framework and a SQL database.

For the frontend, I used Bootstrap and DataTables for a clean layout that has a search function and pagination for the admin inventory table.
